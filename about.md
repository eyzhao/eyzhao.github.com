## Nice to meet you!

Let's stay in touch. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/eyzhao) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zhaoez). Tweeting at me or DM'ing is the best way to get ahold of me. You can also try emailing me at [eric@zhao.science](mailto:eric@zhao.science).

## I'm basically a professional gene hacker

I'm an incoming **resident doctor** at the University of Toronto, specializing in [Radiation Oncology](https://www.radonc.utoronto.ca/). That means I am learning to be an effective cancer doctor, with a focus on treating cancer with radiation. I grew up in a few different cities, but mostly in [Vancouver, BC](https://vancouver.ca/).

**I love health, and I love data**. So I especially love studying how we can use data to improve health. I found out that the human genome is full of health-relevant data and I never looked back. I'm basically a gene hacker - I use data science to uncover new knowledge about the human cancer genome. See my full CV and list of publications [here](/cv).

My **PhD research** happened at the illustrious [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://bcgsc.ca/) in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. I investigated how cancers (fail to) repair their DNA, and how that could improve cancer treatment. For details, see [this academic paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246904) or [this news feature](http://www.aacr.org/Newsroom/Pages/News-Release-Detail.aspx?ItemID=1138#.Wr8vvojwbic). I am an alumnus of the [UBC MD/PhD program](http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/mdphd/).

When I'm not seeing patients or [keeping up with the scientific literature](/scientific-literature), you'll find me tinkering with graphic design, [playing music](/piano), biking around the city, listening to podcasts, shooting photos, and many more things I feel obligated to do as a west coast millenial.
