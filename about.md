## Nice to meet you!

Let's stay in touch. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/eyzhao) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zhaoez). Tweeting at me or DM'ing is the best way to get ahold of me. If you need to, you can also email me at [hello@eyzhao.com](mailto:hello@eyzhao.com).

## I'm basically a professional gene hacker

I'm an **MD/PhD student**. People usually ask "how does that work?" The short answer is I'm cramming medical school and a full PhD into seven breathless years. The long answer is [this](http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/mdphd/).

**I love health, and I love data**. So I especially love studying how we can use data to improve health. I found out that the human genome is full of health-relevant data and I never looked back. I'm basically a gene hacker - I use data science to uncover new knowledge about the human cancer genome.

My **PhD research** happens at the illustrious [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://bcgsc.ca/) in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. I study how cancers (fail to) repair their DNA, and how that could improve cancer treatment. For details, see [this academic paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246904) or [this news feature](http://www.aacr.org/Newsroom/Pages/News-Release-Detail.aspx?ItemID=1138#.Wr8vvojwbic).

When I'm not working or studying, you'll find me tinkering with graphic design, playing music, biking around the city, listening to podcasts, and many more things I feel obligated to do as a west coast millenial.
