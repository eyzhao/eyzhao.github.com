<p>I remember my first typing class, back when such things were still a rarity. My eight year old eyes were trained on a CRT television playing a VHS tape. The video’s presenter introduced the 3rd column: “E D C. Just remember, <strong>E</strong>very <strong>D</strong>ad <strong>C</strong>ares. E D C. Type these with your left middle finger.” Even then, I thought it was a bit arbitrary.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017 and technology is everywhere. The average eight year old digital native can no doubt type faster on an iPhone than I could on a PC.</p>

<p>Still there are hold-overs from a simpler time. The QWERTY keyboard was designed for typewriters. Contrary to popular belief, it was not designed to slow typists down. Rather, its designers aimed to prevent the successive use of neighbouring keys, which could cause typewriter jams. Next time you type, notice the way your hands frequently alternate and dart every which way to hammer out your message.</p>
