I enjoy playing the piano, and have performed on a few occasions at the UBC Medicine Spring Gala. Here are the associated recordings.

- [Trio in D Minor, Op. 49 no. 1, Mvt. I (Abridged) by Felix Mendelssohn,](https://youtu.be/FFLoRvACv6k) performed with Sabine Lague (on flute) and Santa Ono (on cello).
- [Sonate pour flûte et piano (Flute Sonata), FP 164, by Francis Poulenc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giLP4unywQ4&feature=youtu.be), performed with Sabine Lague (on flute).
- ["Un Sospiro," 3 Études de concert, S.144 No. 3 (Liszt, Franz)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lT7WGQSM1w&feature=youtu.be)
