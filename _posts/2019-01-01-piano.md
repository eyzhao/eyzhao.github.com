I have enjoyed playing the piano for decades, and continue to perform on a regular basis. Here are some recordings of mine.

- ["Un Sospiro," 3 Études de concert, S.144 No. 3 (Liszt, Franz)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lT7WGQSM1w&feature=youtu.be)
- [Sonate pour flûte et piano (Flute Sonata), FP 164, by Francis Poulenc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giLP4unywQ4&feature=youtu.be)
